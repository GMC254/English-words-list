    "On June 1, 1996 Grady Ward announced that the 
    fruits of the Moby project were being placed in the public domain:

    The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
    been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
    rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.
    
    Placing this material on internal or public servers is
    also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
    export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide."

As such, I am also placing this git repository into the public domain. 
Use it as you wish with no restrictions placed upon by me.
